IOIO Meter
==========

Note: I wrote this code quite a while ago. Hence, it doesn't use any of the latest Android
features nor is it in good shape, overall. Use with care!

Download the app from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ioiometer).
Screenshots and description are up there, too.

Uses [IOIOLib](https://github.com/ytai/ioio/wiki/IOIOLib-Basics) and
[AChartEngine](http://www.achartengine.org/). Built with AndroidStudio and Gradle.
